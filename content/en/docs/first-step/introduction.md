<h1> DFT-CES Tutorials </h1>

<div class="callout callout-info">
A mean-field QM/MM method, DFT-CES which stands for the <strong> density functional theory in classical explicit solvents.</strong>
</div> 

## What is DFT-CES for?
Describing solvation effects on electronic structures of condensed-phase systems and catalytic systems have been recently studied by a variety of methods such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations coupled with implicit solvation models. However, the specific configuration or stabilization of reactant in solvated system has been reported, and this can be a kinetically significant influence.

Then, how can explicit solvents be considered without much increase in computational cost? What can you see from the result?

We are dealing with this using a mean-field QM/MM method, DFT-CES. You can check the details at [DFT-CES](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00469); J. Chem. Theory Comput. 12, 10 (2016), [DFT-CES2](https://ththjang.github.io); J. Chem. Theory Comput. XXX

Our new generation of QM/MM method has been released in public.

This site has introductory materials which will let you know how to perform DFT-CES simulation, and ways to go further to apply to your own system of interest.

## First Steps

Starting from the installation of open-source programs and relevant libraries, if you are already set to perform calculations in real-space grid with DFT-CES. You can skip here.
